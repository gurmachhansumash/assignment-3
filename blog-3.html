            Svelete is a relatively new framework that aims to replace React by having faster compile speeds, reduced memory usage and smaller bundle sizes. Svelte's syntax is more intuitive and developer-friendly, enabling cleaner, less verbose code and improving developer productivity. I discovered Svelte on a discord server where a bunch of people were talking about new cool stuff on the internet. I think Svelte is a great choice for web development in general as it compiles into highly efficient, vanilla Javascript instead of virtual DOM and runtime used by React.

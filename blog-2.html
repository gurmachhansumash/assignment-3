            MJML is a new markup language which was made specifically to help code responsive emails. It features semantic syntax and rich standard components library which helps to shorten development time. I found this over on Reddit where a guy recommended this for new web devs.I think this new email framework is pretty neat, it pretty much does what every email template does but better.
